# React setup with webpack config file

### Getting Started

Run `npm` or `yarn` to install all node modules.

`yarn build-css` will compile all the scss into a .css file.

`yarn watch-css` will watch for any scss changes and re-compile the .css file.

`yarn dev` will start up the webpack dev server on localhost:8080

`yarn start` will run webpack dev server & watch for scss changes

`yarn prod` build the project for production. Uses Uglifyjs to minify the js file.
