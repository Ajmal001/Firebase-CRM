### CSS / SCSS

This template is setup to use scss, which can be located in `src/css`. All styling can be added to the style.scss file however, you are also able to include stylesheets into the style.scss file to split up styling for different components. A good way is to create a new folder in the css folder called components. Create partial scss files, for example `_component.scss` and then include into the style.scss using `@import 'components/component';`.

The css should be loaded into your Main Container Component. In this template it is being included in the App.js file using the line `const url = require('../dist/css/style.css');`. Webpack will automatically load this file into `<head>` of the DOM, using the `file-loader` loader.
